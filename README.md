# JL19 Equipment Inventory & Loan Management System for AIM-Lab

## Description
This repository will hold my final year project. The web project will be developed with ASP.NET.

## Supervisor
Dr Joanna Lumsden ([j.lumsden@aston.ac.uk](j.lumsden@aston.ac.uk))

## Project brief
The Aston Interactive Media (AIM) Lab is home to a variety of interesting technology, much of which can be signed out on loan by research staff/students working within the lab. This project will design and build - with the AIM Lab Director as client - an online inventory system which will keep track of equipment - spec, purchase date, warranty expiration, date for evergreening, etc. - and will also encompass a sign-out mechanism under the control of the AIM Lab Director such that staff and students can sign-out, under agreed terms and conditions, equipment from the lab and thus the whereabouts of any given item be carefully monitored. Co-requisite modules: CS3410; CS3160
